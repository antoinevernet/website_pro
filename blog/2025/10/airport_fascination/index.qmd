Because https://bsky.app/profile/econmaett.github.io said Hate the Game gave "airport vibes", I went down a rabbit hole of reflecting on my fascination with "airport books".


I aspire to write airport business book.
Comes from the comment from econmaett That the fairweather book I was reading had airport vibes

I am a sucker for books that promise to reveal a big secret and inevitably fall short because the secret is either obvious or something I already know.
What will probably keep me from ever writing one of these book is that I don't know how to pick the right level of argument... These book almost always come out as patronising or helplessly simplistic
