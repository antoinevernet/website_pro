Helpfully, they are both [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comics.

The first comic (Ten Thousand) is a reminder that as teachers, we are privileged to teach a topic we know well to people who are new to it.
To me, this points two things for us to do: 
- First, learn to enjoy that feeling of taking someone through a process of discovery. And think carefully about how to drive that discovery in a way that create excitement and favours learning.
- Second, remember that there are always many more people who still don't know what we just taught. This should be strong motivation to keep on going. Especially in a world increasingly governed by idiots that embrace misinformation, it matters!

The second comic (Average Familiarity) helps me remember that what I have seen labeled the "expert's curse" is real.
It is important to not assume that what is obvious to us is obvious to students, providing scaffolding is particularly important. 
The real difficulty is that we find ourselves in front of heterogenous audiences, and scaffolding necessary for some, is boring repetition for others.
Sometimes we can mitigate this, for example by having the scaffolding as preparatory material that students can review before class if they need it.
Other times, it implies a trade-off and one has to choose a primary audience, and accept that people that do not fit with our primary audience might find us difficult to follow (or blabing on things obvious to them for way longer than they can bear).

I find that thinking about teaching in this way helps me find the right approach when developing material and avoid pitching way off for my audience.
Overall, I feel very lucky to get to guide students in discovering something that I think is worth knowing and can genuinely make their lives better.
