The first comic (Ten Thousand) is a reminder that as teachers, we are privileged to teach a topic we know well to people who are new to it.
It is important to do two things as a result of this: 
- First, learn to enjoy that feeling of taking someone through a process of discovery. And think carefully about how to drive that discovery in a way that create excitement and favours learning.
- Second, remembering that there are always many more people who still don't know what we just taught someone should be strong motivation to keep on going. Especially in a world increasingly governed by idiots that embrace misinformation, it matters!

The second comic (Average Familiarity) helps me remember that what I have seen labeled the "expert's curse" is real.
It is important to not assume that what is obvious to us is obvious to students, providing scaffolding is particularly important. 
The real difficulty is that we find ourselves in front of heterogenous audiences, and scaffolding necessary for some, is boring repetition for others.
Sometimes there are ways to mitigate this, such as having the scaffolding as preparatory material that students can review before class if they need it.
Other times, it implies a trade-off and one has to choose a primary audience.

I find that keeping both of these things in mind helps me keep in mind that I get to guide students to discover something they do not know that I think is worth knowing and genuinely can make their lives better, but also that I need to keep in mind that if I show them only part of the puzzle, I can't assume that they can fill in the blanks.
