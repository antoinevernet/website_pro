Last week, I was talking about how I used gpt4 to get myself out of a colouring book pickle, but my (simplistic) solution, which kept my kids occupied, is already outdated with the release of GPTs: OpenAI has released a GPT that is pre-prompted to produce colouring book images.

I played around with it and it is pretty fun. It did refuse to do fight scenes, but I found a way around by suggesting it was a friendly sparring bout and telling it that it was important for me. As Ethan Mollick says, generative AI is weird.

I have started playing around with creating GPTs and while I haven’t got a killer use yet, it definitely can save you time to have a GPT already geared towards a specific task as soon as you start interacting with it, because you do not have to feed it context every time.

I will write more about GPTs as I get to discover more.

I am curious about your unexpected use of AI: share your stories in the comments below!
