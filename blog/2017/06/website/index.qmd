I decided to redo my old and ugly wordpress website using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
Thanks to the great theme for academics by [George Cushen](https://georgecushen.com/) and the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill, it was a breeze.
In a few hours, I have a better looking website than I thought possible, without having to do too much fiddling.
Once more, I am amazed by what can be achieved thanks to the open source software community.
