## Abstract

Bipartite networks (e.g., software developers linked to open-source projects) are common in settings studied by organization scholars. 
But the structure underlying bipartite networks tends to be overlooked. 
Commonly, two modes are reduced to one mode for analysis, causing loss of information. 
We review techniques for projecting 2-modes onto 1-mode and discuss 2-mode measures of clustering. 
We also address the potential for 2-mode theory development concerning (a) how change in one mode influences change in the other, (b) the question of two types of agency, and (c) how diversity in one mode is a substitute for diversity in the other mode.
